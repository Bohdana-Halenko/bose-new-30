          Firstly, make sure your headphones are turned on with a single press
          of the top button on the back of the right earbud. Then press and hold
          the power button for 3 seconds to put the headphones into pairing
          mode. Please note that if you connect the headphones for the first
          time, they will automatically turn on immediately in this pairing
          mode. Voice prompts will provide you with additional instructions. We
          recommend that you use the Bose Music app to complete the pairing
          process, however you can also use the Bluetooth settings on your
          device.
