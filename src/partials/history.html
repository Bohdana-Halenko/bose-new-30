                The history of Bose Corporation began
                with disappointment. In 1956, MIT graduate student Amar Bose bought one of the best stereo systems at
                the time for his home.
                After a few minutes of listening to the audio recording, his bewilderment turned
                to disappointment.

            <p class="history__left-text">
                From Amar's point of view, the sound was
                so flat and unnatural that it was better not to listen to the music at all than to listen to it in such
                a distorted form.

                Bose's frustration grew into a firm determination to build audio equipments
                that would reproduce sound
                with impeccable accuracy and naturalness
